public class Main {

    // input stream and output stream just read the raw bytes
    // deciding the those bytes mean -> is completely up to programmer and the code


    // 1. Chaining Filters Together
    // 2. Buffered Stream
        // A protected byte array field named buf until the buffer is full or the stream is flushed
        // A single write of many bytes is almost always much faster than many small writes that add up to the same thing
        // Only when the buffer runs out of data does the stream read from the underlying source.
        // At this point, it reads as much data as it can from the source into the buffer, whether it needs all the data immediately or not
    // 3. PrintStream
        // Other output stream can also be chained to print stream with constructor
        // Print streams should be explicitly flushed, but we can auto
            // auto flush when every time a byte array or linefeed is written or when println() method is invoked
        // 10 overload println() and 9 overload print()
            // converts its argument o a string in a predictable fashion and writes the string to underlying output stream using default encoding
        // Problem with PrintStream
            // -- Platform dependent : lines may sometimes be broken with a linefeed, a carriage return , console is okay, but network is not
            // -- Using default encoding of the platform on which it's running. But it may not be what server or client expects -> can not change the default encoding
            // -- PrintStream eats all exceptions. It relies on an outdated and inadequate error flag. Must check every call. Furthermore, once an error has occurred, there is no wat to
            //    unset a flag -> no error is detect
    // 4. DataStream
            // The Network Time Protocol (NTP) represents times as 64-bit unsigned fixed point numbers with the integer
            // part in the first 32 bits and the fraction part in the last 32 bits
    // 5. Reader and Writer
            // Many modern protocols, that allow a wide variety of localized encodings
            // And Java Native character set is UTF-18 encoding of Unicode -> when the encoding is no longer ASCII -> things breaks down
            // InputStreamReader: reads from raw bytes and translates bytes into Unicode characters
            // OutputStreamReader: receives unicode characters and then translate into bytes
            // Class that extends Reader and Write
                    // FileReader (work with files)
                    // FileWriter (work with files)
                    // StringReader (work inside java)
                    // StringWriter (work inside java)
                    // CharArrayWriter (work inside java)
                    // CharArrayReader (work inside java)
            // 1. Writer
                // How to write
                        // Note Other encodings may write still different sequences of bytes. The exact output depend on the encoding.
                // 1.1 OutputStreamWriter (Most important)
                    // Receives characters from a java program -> converts these into bytes according to a  specified encoding -> writes them onto an underling output stream
            // 2. Reader
                // The read() method returns a single Unicode character as an int with a value from 0 to 65,535 or â€“1 on end of stream
                // The read(char[] bytes)  tries to fill the array text with characters and returns the actual number of characters read or -1 for end of stream
                // The read(char[] bytes, int offset, int length)
                // mark(int aheadLimit), reset(), markSupported()
                // ready(): return boolean -> indicating whether the reader may  be read without blocking
                // available(): return int specifying a minimum number of bytes that may be read without blocking
            // 2.1 InputStreamReader (Most Important)
                // Reads bytes from underlying input stream (FileInputStream, TelnetInputStream) -> converts these into characters according to a specified encoding and return them
    //Question: what read() return mean ? -> Return the number represent
    // Filter Readers and Writers
        // BufferedReader, BufferedWriter: character-based equivalents of byte-oriented BufferedInputStream,BufferedOutputStream
            // When a program reads from a BufferedReader, text is taken from the buffer rather than directly from the underlying input stream or other text source
        // LineNumberReader, PrintWriter

        // PushBackReader

    // readLine() from DataOutStream deprecated
    // readLine() from InputStreamReader: . The big difference is that by chaining a
    //BufferedReader to an InputStreamReader, you can correctly read lines in character
    //sets other than the default encoding for the platform

    // 6. PrintWriter
